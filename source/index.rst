Threat Intelligence
===============================================

Many forms of attacks are common today, including zero-day exploits, malware, phishing, on-path (man-in-the-middle)
attacks, and denial of service attacks. Different ways of attacking computer systems and networks constantly evolve
as attackers find new vulnerabilities to exploit.

Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) helps stay informed about new threats. Security experts organise, analyse, and
refine the information they gather about attacks, so they can be learned from to protect organisations better.
