Threat Intelligence
===============================================

Vulnerability intelligence is just one stage in the vulnerability management lifecycle. Where many organisations
fall flat is having a vulnerability intelligence program without an actionable vulnerability management strategy –
or vice versa.

Vulnerability intelligence will only tell you what the current vulnerabilities are and what type of risk these
vulnerabilities present. It won’t, however, tell you what to do about them or whether you should do anything at all.
That is all part of the ongoing cycle of vulnerability management. Likewise vulnerability management without
intelligence can’t tell you which vulnerabilities exist at all.

When it comes to building a threat intelligence and vulnerability management strategy, there are a few best practices
to get started: Plan ahead with room for flexibility; Understand threat priorities; *Strategically* patch and apply
updates.
