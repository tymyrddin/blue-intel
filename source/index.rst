Threat intelligence
===============================================

Many forms of attacks are common today, including zero-day exploits, malware, phishing, on-path (man-in-the-middle)
attacks, and denial of service attacks. Different ways of attacking computer systems and networks constantly evolve
as attackers find new vulnerabilities to exploit.

Cyber threat intelligence (CTI) helps stop or mitigate an attack that is in progress. The more an
IT team understands about an attack, the better they will be able to make an informed decision about how to counter it.
