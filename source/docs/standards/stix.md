# STIX

[Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX)](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro) is a 
language developed for the "specification, capture, characterisation and communication of standardised cyber threat 
information". It provides defined relationships between sets of threat info such as observables, indicators, adversary 
TTPs, attack campaigns, and more.
