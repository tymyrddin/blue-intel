# Data collection

Many forms of attacks are common today, including zero-day exploits, malware, phishing, on-path (man-in-the-middle) 
attacks, and denial of service attacks. Different ways of attacking computer systems and networks constantly evolve 
as attackers find new vulnerabilities to exploit. 

Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) helps stay informed about new threats. Security experts organise, analyse, and 
refine the information they gather about attacks, so they can be learned from to protect organisations better.

This evidence-based information may include:

* Mechanisms of an attack
* How to detect an attack
* Impact of different types of attacks
* Action-oriented advice about how to defend against attacks 

Threat intelligence (or security intelligence) also helps stop or mitigate an attack that is in progress. The more 
an IT team understands about an attack, the better they will be able to make an informed decision about how to combat 
it.

## Feeds

If you want to become more proactive in collecting data there are a number of open source threat feeds you can use 
to stay informed of suspicious IP addresses and domains as a starting point for threat research.
