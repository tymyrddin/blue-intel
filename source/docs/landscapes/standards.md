## TAXII

The [Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII)](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/taxii/intro) 
defines protocols for securely exchanging threat Intel to have near real-time detection, prevention and mitigation of 
threats. The protocol supports two sharing models:

* Collection: Threat intel is collected and hosted by a producer upon request by users using a request-response model.
* Channel: Threat intel is pushed to users from a central server through a publish-subscribe model.

## STIX

[Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX)](https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/intro) is a 
language developed for the "specification, capture, characterisation and communication of standardised cyber threat 
information". It provides defined relationships between sets of threat info such as observables, indicators, adversary 
TTPs, attack campaigns, and more.
