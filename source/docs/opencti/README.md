# Introduction

## What?

[OpenCTI](https://www.opencti.io/), an open-source threat intelligence platform, can use the MITRE ATT&CK framework to 
structure the data. Additionally, it can be integrated with other threat intel tools such as 
[MISP](blue-threats:docs/misp/README) and TheHive. 

## Why?

Manage CTI through the storage, analysis, visualisation and presentation of threat campaigns, malware and IOCs.
